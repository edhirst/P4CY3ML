# Weighted Projective Spaces ML
Description:  
The database of 5-vectors describing 4d weighted projective spaces which admit Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces are examined with supervised and unsupervised ML techniques.      
  
How to run:  
~ Datasets available in the folder `Data`, including the h11 clustering results.  
~ Scripts related to investigations are labelled accordingly. They are run cell-by-cell sequentially with commented points to change parameters for analysis. ML is run with the use of sci-kit learn.
